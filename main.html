	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational efficiency of an algorithm. It helps us understand how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input, making it a crucial factor in designing efficient algorithms.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. It is often represented using notation like O(n), which helps in analyzing and optimizing memory usage for programs.</p>
